# Neuralynx Open Ephys Plugin

Plugin for the Open Ephys GUI to read data from Nerualynx systems such as ATLAS and Digital Lynx SX. These systems have a non-publicly-documented duplicated data output that sends UDP packets containing neural data during acquisition. This plugin is a data thread that receives these packets and sends them into an Open Ephys signal chain.

The source code and functionality of this program are subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Neuralynx, Inc. Contact Neuralynx for access to the NDA and then contact markschatza@gmail.com to obtain access to the private reporsitory.

## Usage:

With a typical configuration, if the network connection is configured as described above (hidden), the plugin should "just work" - when acquisition has started and data is flowing, it should turn from gray to orange and "Not receiving" should be replaced with "Receiving:" and information about the number of channels and sample rate.
